1. Get Mission waypoints co-ordinates and altitudes.
2. Input said co-ordinates and altitudes as well as payload(purple) area co-ordinates into Travelling statesman probelem and find optimum path (Starting town is closest to tent)
3. create an array of waypoints and purple box co-ordinates in order
4. Arm the drone
5. Send command liftoff 15m through pymavlink
6. use pymavelink command "set_position_target_global_int_send" and set target to waypoints[i]
7. Run step 6 again with i=i+1, once drone reaches the waypoints. Exit when len(array)>i
8. Keep checking if curr GPS location is within Purple Box co-ordinates, if yes do step 10
9. Once last waypoint is reached, return to waypoint 1, and execute step 6 through 8.
10. execute the program object_gps.py, which splits frames, geotags it and checks if object is in current frame, if yes add to an array called "check_gps_points"
11. after One round of drone is over(check_gps_points array is not empty), whenever the drone comes within 15m of the given gps location execute step 13.
12. Continue steps 6 through 12 till counter reaches 5.
13. trigger the AUX pin for corresponding payload
    object 0 - AUX 1
    object 1 - AUX 2
    object 2 - AUX 3
    object 3 - AUX 4

Pros -
    1. Latency issue is altogether abandonded, and becomes a non issue
    2. Variability of mavlink command "target_local_ned_send" is abandoned(sometimes the drone may turn to north and sometimes it may not) - According to Anfil Sir
    3. Less complexity, and total mission can be setup from python, only inputs are waypoints and altitudes
    4. whole mission can be completed using Guided mode- no need to switch from AUTO mode to Loiter and etc


Cons -
    1. Only mapping of Object Deployment zone (purple is completed)
    2. Waypoints are only immediate locations to cover and not acutal mission params (Guided mode only supports immediate locations, AUTO mode supports full missions)
    3. Traveling statesman approach is fully theoretical at this point and cant be trusted to give a proper output.
